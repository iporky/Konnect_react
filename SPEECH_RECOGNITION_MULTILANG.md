# Multi-Language Speech Recognition Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides dynamic language support for speech recognition in the React frontend. Users can select their preferred language from the navigation menu, and the speech recognition will automatically switch to use that language.

## Components

### 1. Language Mapping (`src/utils/speechLanguages.js`)
- Maps user-friendly language names to Web Speech API language codes
- Supports 50+ languages including Korean, Spanish, Hindi, and other top spoken languages
- Provides utility functions for language conversion and validation
- Includes regional variants for better accuracy

### 2. Language Context (`src/contexts/LanguageContext.js`)
- Global state management for selected language
- Persists language selection in localStorage
- Provides speech recognition language code to components

### 3. Updated Speech Recognition Hook (`src/hooks/useSpeechRecognition.js`)
- Enhanced to support dynamic language switching
- Includes `changeLanguage()` method for runtime language updates
- Tracks current language state
- Maintains all existing functionality

### 4. Navigation Component Updates (`src/components/Navigation.js`)
- Language selection modal now shows supported languages
- Visual indicators for speech recognition support (üé§ icon)
- Current selected language is highlighted
- Clicking a language updates the global context

### 5. Home Page Integration (`src/pages/Home.js`)
- Uses language context for speech recognition
- Automatically updates speech recognition when language changes
- Preserves all existing speech functionality

### 6. Search Input Enhancements (`src/components/SearchInput.js`)
- Displays current language in microphone tooltip
- Shows language code for technical reference
- Enhanced tooltip with language information

## Supported Languages

### Top 10 Most Spoken Languages
1. **English** (`en-US`) - Default
2. **Spanish** (`es-ES`)
3. **Mandarin Chinese** (`zh-CN`)
4. **Hindi** (`hi-IN`)
5. **Arabic** (`ar-SA`)
6. **Portuguese** (`pt-BR`)
7. **Russian** (`ru-RU`)
8. **Japanese** (`ja-JP`)
9. **Korean** (`ko-KR`)
10. **French** (`fr-FR`)

### Additional Supported Languages
- German, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Turkish
- Ukrainian, Greek, Hebrew, Czech, Hungarian
- Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malay, Filipino
- Bengali, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati
- Swahili, Zulu, Afrikaans, and many more

## Usage

### For Users
1. Click the "Language" icon in the navigation sidebar
2. Search or scroll to find your preferred language
3. Click on the language to select it
4. Languages with speech recognition support show a üé§ icon
5. Start using voice input - it will automatically use your selected language

### For Developers
```javascript
// Access current language
const { selectedLanguage, speechLanguageCode } = useLanguage();

// Use in speech recognition
const speechRecognition = useSpeechRecognition({
  language: speechLanguageCode
});

// Change language programmatically
speechRecognition.changeLanguage('ko-KR'); // Switch to Korean
```

## Technical Features

### Language Detection and Fallback
- Automatically falls back to English if selected language is not supported
- Validates language codes against Web Speech API compatibility
- Logs language changes for debugging

### Regional Variants
- Multiple regional variants for major languages
- Example: Spanish supports ES, MX, AR, CO, CL, PE, VE variants
- Improves recognition accuracy for regional accents

### Performance Optimizations
- Language mapping is cached and memoized
- Context updates only trigger re-renders when language actually changes
- Speech recognition instance is reused when possible

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when speech recognition is not supported
- Clear error messages for different failure scenarios
- Language-specific error handling

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Chromium: Full support for all languages
- Safari: Good support for major languages
- Firefox: Limited support (may require additional configuration)
- Edge: Full support for all languages

## Future Enhancements
1. Voice training for better accuracy
2. Custom vocabulary for domain-specific terms
3. Automatic language detection from speech
4. Offline speech recognition support
5. Custom language models for specific use cases

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Select a non-English language from the navigation
2. Click the microphone icon in the search bar
3. Speak in the selected language
4. Verify the speech is recognized correctly
5. Check the tooltip shows the correct language

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Language not recognized**: Check browser support for that language
2. **Speech not working**: Ensure microphone permissions are granted
3. **Wrong language detected**: Verify language selection in navigation
4. **Performance issues**: Check console for language switching logs

### Debug Information
- Language changes are logged to console with üåç emoji
- Speech recognition start/stop events show current language
- Tooltip displays both display name and language code
